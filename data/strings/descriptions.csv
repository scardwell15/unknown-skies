US_acid,PLANET,"Acid Worlds are rich in common minerals, with heavy deposits of formic, hydrochloric, hydro-cyanic, nitric, phosphoric, and sulfuric acids. They appear green from space with a green and brown surface.",,,
,,,,,
US_alkali,PLANET,"Alkali Worlds are rich in alkali base metals, with medium deposits of strontium, barium, and calcium. They appear green from space, with blotches of teal and blue on the surface. May support some life.",,,
,,,,,
US_artificial,PLANET,"Artificial is actually a misnomer as these are in fact telluric planets, the surfaces of which are entirely covered over with artificial structures. Theories abound as to what created them, the most popular being that they are the product of rogue Domain construction drones abandoned after the Collapse - left to build then rebuild the entire surface into a maze of concrete, until they fell into dust themselves.",,,
,,,,,
US_auric,PLANET,"Auric Worlds have a huge metallic core, often composed of gold but difficult to collect given their deep gravitic well for their size. They appear yellow from space and can support some life.",,,
,,,,,
US_azure,PLANET,"Azure worlds feature light deposits of indium, vanadium, and molybdenum giving them a characteristic blue tint from space, with a heavily cratered surface. Rarely possessing any atmosphere, they are usually devoid of life and rarely targeted for colonization.",,,
,,,,,
US_burnt,PLANET,"Exactly what it says on the tin: Burnt planet are telluric bodies orbiting older stars on very stable orbits. They have been subject to billions of years of heat and radiation, leaving them utterly lifeless and inhabitable. The degenerating isotopes composing their crust also make them unsuitable for sustained exploitation.",,,
,,,,,
US_red,PLANET,"A deathly dry world with an ominous red crust. The surface exhibits the warm hue of oxidized iron compounds as well as heavy carbide concentration. A thin atmosphere prevails on worlds of this class, the predominant carbon dioxide stirred occasionally into planet-wide dust storms. Icecaps of atmospheric CO2 may form and sublime with the turn of the seasons.",,,
,,,,,
US_green,PLANET,"The stunning green surface of these planets get its tint from the high concentration of pure chlorine and hydrochloric acids, making it toxic to all known life. In addition, the volatile emanations from the exposed surface create a runaway greenhouse effect that increases surface temperature and atmospheric pressures to extremely high levels.",,,
,,,,,
US_purple,PLANET,"A frozen world of liquid methane. The surface is very cold indeed, but it is human-viable if precautions are observed. Carbon dioxide may freeze out of the atmosphere at the poles during the local winter. Limited biospheres have been sometimes observed deep under the oceans surface. Such life-forms cannot be exploited in any useful way except as topics for xenobiology book.",,,
,,,,,
US_crimson,PLANET,"An inhospitable, dry world that has a much thinner atmosphere than the terran standard, leaving the surface vulnerable to asteroid bombardment. Nonetheless it is massive enough to retain some of the water brought by the constant barrage, and a magnetic field protects the surface from stellar radiation permitting a limited biosphere to slowly eke out an existence here.",,,
,,,,,
US_arid,PLANET,"This planet present a stark dichotomy between vast oceans and bone-dry deserts swirling with dust. It appears that abnormal tectonic movements prevented the proper formation of a planetary crust, leading to the creation of a deep fractal maze of canyons and chasms preventing the presence of water reserves on most of the surface. Despite this, the rare oceans are often teeming with cellular life.",,,
,,,,,
US_dust,PLANET,"This very old world is dry as bone and continually clouded by dust storms. High plateaus indicate the presence of former continents on a world that used to be covered with liquid water, dissipated over the aeons due to a weakening magnetic field. Now stellar radiation mercilessly beats the surface.",,,
,,,,,
US_continent,PLANET,"A world consisting of more or less a single landmass and two polar oceans. With water in abundance and a thick atmosphere, this planet would be a top colonization candidate but the extreme climate of freezing winters and blistering summers makes local food production problematic at best. Still, a limited biosphere of bacteria, lichen and insects makes do to survive on the planet's surface.",,,
,,,,,
US_lifeless,PLANET,"A planet with a fully functional water cycle which for some reason never held any form of life. A perfect target for colonization, as the lack of any previous biosphere means no competition for an imported one.",,,
,,,,,
US_magnetic,PLANET,"Shielded from radiation due to their exceptionally strong magnetic field, these planets are often home of some form of life or at least habitable to a degree. At first glance one could mistakenly assume that the peculiar topology of the planet was directly caused by the magnetic field shaping the crust itself - fortunately not the case as a magnetic field of that strength would have also perturbed the orbits of other bodies in the system. In fact, the relief exposes the influence of the magnetic field on the planet's weather patterns and iron-rich surface water.",,,
,,,,,
US_storm,PLANET,"A planet that has been slowly ground into a smooth sphere by constant strong winds carrying dense clouds of grit and other abrasive material. While usually habitable, the surface conditions are harsh due to the constant equipment wear and the risk of being struck by rogue storm-tossed objects. This makes colonies on them easily defensible, albeit at an ongoing cost.",,,
,,,,,
US_archipelago,PLANET," A telluric planet entirely covered by liquid water, with a few active volcanoes dotting the surface of its world ocean. The biosphere here is rich and relentless thanks to the rapid surface CO2 cycle and stable depths. The idyllic setting can be somewhat spoiled for prospecting colons by the occasional giant predator attack.",,,
