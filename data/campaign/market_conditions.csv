Magnetic Crust,US_magnetic,TRUE,,data.scripts.campaign.econ.US_magnetic,"$market's crust is extremely rich in magnesite and has a dense iron core, leading to an exceptionally strong magnetic field. While this handily prevents any harmful radiation from hitting the surface, it also hinders colonization efforts: All electronic components, civilian or otherwise, must be heavily shielded against the adverse effects of such intense magnetism. It does however gives a massive advantage to defenders in case of an invasion, since radio-communications - unlike hardened land-lines - are naturally scrambled.",graphics/icons/markets/US_magnetic.png,10
Chaotic Structures,US_artificial,TRUE,,data.scripts.campaign.econ.US_artificial,"$market is entirely covered by a Escherian maze of empty buildings, unfinished tunnels, intermittent roads and all sorts of random structures. Un-intuitively, this does not facilitate colonies establishment or growth as the architectural chaos is not laid out according to any sort of coherent city-plan. On the other hand, the landscape is extremely defensible against any invader that lacks a precise 3D scan of the region to map all of the paths leading to nowhere from the myriad of open and hidden passages.",graphics/icons/markets/US_artificial.png,10
Perpetual Dust Storm,US_storm,TRUE,,data.scripts.campaign.econ.US_storm,"$market is engulfed in a perpetual dust storm, increasing material wear and forcing any settlement underground. The extremely difficult landing conditions also have a dampening effect on any commerce. However these conditions also apply to invaders, who will be at an even worse disadvantage against entrenched defenses.",graphics/icons/markets/dust_storm.png,10

Military Virus,US_virus,TRUE,,data.scripts.campaign.econ.US_virus,"$market would be a desirable locale, if it were not for a lingering military virus deployed in some long-forgotten conflict. While the native wildlife is unaffected, human personnel and inhabitants have to take extreme precautions to survive.  Additionally, in the case of a battle or invasion any damage to a structure is a new potential point of contamination. This constant Sword of Damocles hanging over the heads of the population makes for a far less attractive place to live, leading to a significantly reduced immigration rate. It does however makes for an absolute perfect location to build a bio-weapon production facility.",graphics/icons/markets/xenoplague.png,10
Parasitic Spores,US_mind,TRUE,,data.scripts.campaign.econ.US_mind,"$market seems to be home of a very peculiar plant, one whose spores can influence mammals cognitive processes. Affected individuals present a heightened sense of empathy as well as, well, a flourishing libido. Sadly the spore also affects the motor-control centers of the brain, shortening the affected subject's attention span and reducing their ability to complete precise or complex tasks.",graphics/icons/markets/US_mind.png,10
Psychoactive Fungus,US_shrooms,TRUE,,data.scripts.campaign.econ.US_shrooms,"Among the native lifeforms of $market, a species of fungi has been identified as having a strong psychoactive property. While most people have obvious reserves about eating an alien organism that will alter your cognition processes, a small subset of the sector's population is ready to buy these fungi for a hefty sum. Additionally, having a portion of the population both local and touring the planet high on drugs will cause some unavoidable tensions.",graphics/icons/markets/US_fungus.png,10

Pre-Collapse Military Base,US_base,TRUE,,data.scripts.campaign.econ.US_base,"$market was a large military center before the Collapse. While long abandoned and unusable, some of the documentation and tools survived. This can help to refine production protocols, leading to a stark improvement in quality of the ships built locally.",graphics/icons/markets/arms_tradeshow.png,10

Ancient Religious Landmark,US_religious,TRUE,,data.scripts.campaign.econ.US_religious,"Before the Collapse, $market seems to have been an important destination for religious people. Some sites are still standing today and their rediscovery is sure to bring in a flock of immigrant as well as improve the local commerce.",graphics/icons/markets/US_religious.png,10
Floating Continent,US_floating,TRUE,,com.fs.starfarer.api.impl.campaign.econ.BaseHazardCondition,"Vast structures were built in $market's upper atmosphere before the Collapse, providing much needed landmass for colonization. While most of the buildings upon them have been irremediably damaged by time, winds and storms, the platforms themselves were built to last and can still be used today.",graphics/icons/markets/US_floating.png,10
Crashed Terraforming Drone,US_crash,TRUE,,data.scripts.campaign.econ.US_crash,"While most of $market has an extremely harsh environment, a crashed terraforming drone has managed to maintain an habitable oasis around itself. However the habitable area is limited and will not extend far enough for a large colony, should one be established on this planet.",graphics/icons/markets/US_crash.png,10
Old Space Accelerator,US_elevator,TRUE,,data.scripts.campaign.econ.US_elevator,"Space Accelerators are a very cheap way to gain access to low planetary orbit. While they require more infrastructure work than a basic spaceport and are not suited to handle as much freight, they can be placed in close proximity of a settlement. Thus they are only deployed in the early stage of a colonization effort should an optimal equatorial position be found. This old structure has been abandoned for decades, but seems to still be in good enough shape to be reactivated.",graphics/icons/markets/US_accelerator.png,10
Underground Network,US_tunnels,TRUE,,data.scripts.campaign.econ.US_tunnels,"$market has been exploited by mining drones in the past, leaving a large network of criss-crossing tunnels going deep inside its crust. Although tunnel collapse is an ever-present danger in the volatile regions closer to the planet's core, surface tunnels can be easily sealed and protect a colony from harm by the environment.",graphics/icons/markets/US_tunnels.png,10
Accessible Sub-Ice Bedrock,US_bedrock,TRUE,,com.fs.starfarer.api.impl.campaign.econ.BaseHazardCondition,"Some areas of $market have a stable ice sheet thin enough that it is possible to dig down to the actual bedrock of the planet. This allows the establishment of stable underground colonies that can then access hidden liquid oceans or use geothermal power-plants to generate energy, the mantle of ice above shielding them from most harm.",graphics/icons/markets/US_bedrock.png,10

Chemical Crystals,US_crystals,TRUE,,data.scripts.campaign.econ.US_crystals,"The extreme conditions on $market allowed for the growth of sprawling crystalline structures. A good marketing team would be able to fetch a high price from collectors and the gullible bourgeoisie that is always on the lookout for the next thing to fascinate guests.",graphics/icons/markets/US_crystals.png,10
